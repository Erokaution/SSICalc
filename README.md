# SSICalc
A SSI calculator. Calculates how much total income you'd receive if you got SSI and had a job, and kept Social Security updated to how much you were making so they could adjust your SSI accordingly.
This was created mostly for personal use so I can estimate how much money I'd make if I had a minimum wage job and part time work, where I was at.
